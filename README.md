# Capital Bikeshare Data Analysis

An exploratory data analysis project investigating ride data from the Capital Bikeshare program during 2020–2021.

## Overview

Capital Bikeshare (CaBi) is a bike-sharing service operating in Washington, DC. This project explores publicly available ride data to uncover patterns in user behavior, seasonal usage, and other key operational insights. Understanding these trends can help improve operational efficiency, customer satisfaction, and support the growth of sustainable transport.

## Project Goals

Aimed to answer three core questions of our choosing using the dataset:

1. What temporal patterns (seasonal, daily, hourly) exist in bike usage?
2. How does user type (e.g., casual vs. member) affect ride characteristics?
3. Are there significant distance trends based on station locations?
